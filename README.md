## PART 2

REFLECTION:

This class was the first time i had ever properly worked with terminal. it took some time for me to understand the concepcts at the beginning, but soon i had a good grasp on the topics. one aspect about this class which i found very interessting was using `vim` . being able to edit whole files form the terminal itself was a really quick and cool way to fix small bugs. overall this this class helped me learn a lot about directories and terminal commands. the practical lab work was also an amazing aspect.
